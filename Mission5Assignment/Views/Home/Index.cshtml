            <h2>Welcome to My Hockey Lesson Page</h2>

            <p>I grew up in California and developed a love for hockey at a young age. I joined local recreational leagues and clubs, where I spent countless hours at the rink, building my skills and deepening my passion for the game.</p>

            <p>Later, I had the opportunity to serve my mission in Minnesota and Canada, where I experienced firsthand just how much hockey means to the people there. From outdoor rinks to packed arenas, I saw the dedication and enthusiasm that make these communities so special. Being surrounded by such a rich hockey culture gave me a new appreciation for the sport and the way it brings people together.</p>

            <p>Now, I’m passionate about teaching the fundamentals and helping beginners build confidence on the ice. No matter what part of your game you want to improve, I’m here to help!</p>
